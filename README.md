## Introduction

[Dependency-Track](https://dependencytrack.org/) offers a fairly sophisticated auditing workflow for vulnerabilities 
and policy violations.

I often found myself wanting a mechanism that lets me make more generalized audit decisions that would affect
multiple (and sometimes even *all*) projects in my portfolio. While the most common use case for something like this
is definitely suppressing false positives, there are times when other audit actions are desirable as well.
A [suppression file](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/general/suppression.html) as seen in projects like 
[Dependency-Check](https://jeremylong.github.io/DependencyCheck/) simply won't cut it.

I've written a fair share of tools that provide the desired functionality based on some kind of configuration file, 
but I quickly came to the realization that configuration files are too limiting for my needs. 
Not only are they not a good fit for dynamic decisions, they are also a pain to test.

It turns out that you can have your cake and eat it too using *policy as code*. The most popular implementation of PaC 
probably being [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) (OPA). 

Think of *dtapac* as a bridge between Dependency-Track and OPA.

![Overview](./.github/images/overview.png)

> Note that *dtapac* as it stands now is **not** intended for performing all auditing through it.
> It's not a complete replacement for manual auditing. Use it for decisions that are likely to affect larger
> parts of your portfolio. Check the [example policies](./examples/policies) to get an idea of what *dtapac*
> can be used for.

## How it works

### Ad-hoc auditing through notifications

The main way that *dtapac* uses to integrate with Dependency-Track is by consuming 
[notifications](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/integrations/notifications/) (aka alerts). 
When receiving a `NEW_VULNERABILITY` or `POLICY_VIOLATION` notification, *dtapac* will immediately 
query OPA for an analysis decision. 

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Client
    Client->>Dependency-Track: Upload BOM
    Dependency-Track->>Dependency-Track: Analyze BOM
    alt New Vulnerability identified
        Dependency-Track->>dtapac: NEW_VULNERABILITY notification
    else Policy Violation identified
        Dependency-Track->>dtapac: POLICY_VIOLATION notification
    end
    dtapac->>OPA: Query analysis decision
    OPA->>OPA: Evaluate policy
    OPA->>dtapac: Analysis decision
    dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Query existing analysis
    Dependency-Track->>dtapac: Analysis
    dtapac->>dtapac: Compare analyses
    opt Analysis has changed
        dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Update analysis
    end
```

*dtapac* will only submit the resulting analysis if it differs from what's already recorded in Dependency-Track. 
This ensures that the audit trail won't be cluttered with redundant information, even if *dtapac* receives multiple 
notifications for the same finding or policy violation.

Note that this also means that if you make changes to an analysis that *dtapac* applied for you in Dependency-Track,
*dtapac* will override it during its next execution. This is by design.

### Portfolio auditing on policy change

If configured, *dtapac* can listen for [status updates](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-status/) 
from OPA. *dtapac* will keep track of the revision of the policy bundle, and trigger a portfolio-wide analysis when it 
changes.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    loop Periodically
        OPA->>Nginx: Pull Bundle
        Nginx->>OPA: archive
    end
    loop Periodically
        OPA->>dtapac: Status
        dtapac->>dtapac: Compare reported bundle revision with last-known
        opt Bundle revision changed
            dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Fetch all projects
            Dependency-Track->>dtapac: Projects
            loop For each project
                dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Fetch all findings & policy violations
                Dependency-Track->>dtapac: Findings & policy violations
                loop For each finding & policy violation
                    dtapac->>OPA: Query analysis decision
                    OPA->>OPA: Evaluate policy
                    OPA->>dtapac: Analysis decision
                    dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Query existing analysis
                    Dependency-Track->>dtapac: Analysis
                    dtapac->>dtapac: Compare analyses
                    opt Analysis has changed
                        dtapac->>Dependency-Track: Update analysis
                    end
                end
            end
        end
    end
```

This makes it possible to have new policies applied to the entire portfolio shortly after publishing them, without the
need to restart any service or edit files on any server.

### Shortcomings

Some limitations of *dtapac* that you should be aware of before using it:

* **No retries**. If an analysis decision could not be submitted to Dependency-Track for any reason, it won't be retried.
* **No persistence**. If you stop *dtapac* while it's still processing something, that something is gone.
* **No access control**. *dtapac* trusts that whatever is inside the notifications it receives is valid. Notifications can be forged. Expose *dtapac* to an internal network or use a service mesh.
  * [Webhook authentication](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/1555) is a planned feature in Dependency-Track.

## Usage

```
USAGE
  dtapac [FLAGS...]

Audit Dependency-Track findings and policy violations via policy as code.

FLAGS
  -config ...                 Path to config file
  -dry-run=false              Only log analyses but don't apply them
  -dtrack-apikey ...          Dependency-Track API key
  -dtrack-url ...             Dependency-Track API server URL
  -finding-policy-path ...    Policy path for finding analysis
  -host 0.0.0.0               Host to listen on
  -log-json=false             Output log in JSON format
  -log-level info             Log level
  -opa-url ...                Open Policy Agent URL
  -port 8080                  Port to listen on
  -violation-policy-path ...  Policy path for violation analysis
  -watch-bundle ...           OPA bundle to watch
```

All options can alternatively be provided via configuration file and environment variables.

## Writing Policies

The basic idea is that a policy receives a finding or policy violation as input and returns an analysis.

![Policy Overview](./.github/images/policy_overview.png)

OPA's policy language is powerful yet concise and is a perfect fit for our use case.

Please take a moment to read a little about [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/) and
[Rego](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/). I can also recommend
the [Rego style guide](https://github.com/StyraInc/rego-style-guide) for a little more hands-on advice.

### Structure

Policies written in Rego are designed to return either one or multiple results. If a policy is written in a way
that only allows for a single result, OPA will fail when multiple rules match the given input. If a policy allows
for multiple results, OPA (per default) makes no guarantees regarding the order in which results are returned.

This behavior is problematic for *dtapac* for the following reasons:

* For any given finding or violation, there should always be *exactly one* analysis, or none at all
  * Multiple analyses for the same finding make no sense
* It is inevitable that multiple policy rules match
  * If one rule matches on vulnerability V, and another on component C, both will match an alert about C being affected by V

Luckily, OPA provides a way to indicate that the first matching rule should take precedence over others: [`else`](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/faq/#statement-order).
Policies for *dtapac* thus must be more or less a single if-else-statement (refer to the [example policies](./examples/policies) 
to see how that looks like).

You as policy author have to ensure that you define your rules in an order that fits your requirements.
For example, ordering them by applicability from broad to specific:

![Policy Structure](./.github/images/policy_structure.png)

### Guidelines

Policies for *dtapac* must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Result MUST be named `analysis`
2. Result MUST be an object
3. There MUST be exactly one result named `analysis`
    * In case of conflicting rules, use [`else`](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/faq/#statement-order)
    * [Incremental definitions](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/#incremental-definitions) are NOT supported
4. If no rule is matched, an empty object MUST be returned
    * Use `default analysis = {}` for this
5. Policies for findings and violations MUST be in separate packages
    * For example, use `package dtapac.finding` for findings and `package dtapac.violation` for violations

Have a look at the example policies at [`./examples/policies`](./examples/policies) if you need inspiration.

### Inputs

#### Finding

For findings, the `input` document is structured as follows:

```json
{
  "component": {},
  "project": {},
  "vulnerability": {}
}
```

The available properties of those fields are documented here:

* [`component`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nscuro/dtrack-client#Component)
* [`project`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nscuro/dtrack-client#Project)
* [`vulnerability`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nscuro/dtrack-client#Vulnerability)

Obviously not all properties are always available.

```

### Results

#### Finding

A finding analysis has the same fields as in the Dependency-Track UI:

```json
{
  "state": "",
  "justification": "",
  "response": "",
  "details": "",
  "comment": "",
  "suppress": false
}
```

You can set all fields, or none. No field is strictly required, but it's good practice to at least provide
a `state`, and a `comment` or `justification`. 

##### Example

```json
{
  "state": "EXPLOITABLE",
  "details": "Exploitable because I say so."
}
```

#### Violation

A violation analysis has the same fields as in the Dependency-Track UI:

```json
{
   "state": "",
   "comment": "",
   "suppress": false
}
```

##### Example

```json
{
   "state": "APPROVED",
   "comment": "Bill paid me to approve all his violations.",
   "suppress": true
}
```

## Policy Management

It is generally a good idea to keep your policies in their own Git repository.
Treat it just like any other code in your SDLC:

* Write tests
* Create pull requests
* Perform code reviews
* Have a CI pipeline

In your policy CI pipeline, you should:

* [Check](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/cli/#opa-check) your policies using [strict mode](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/strict/) and [schemas](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/schemas/)
    * You can use the input schemas in [`./examples/schemas`](./examples/policies)
    * If you want to write your own schemas, be aware of the [limitations](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/schemas/#limitations)
* [Test](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-testing/) your policies
* Package your policies into a [bundle](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-bundles/#bundle-file-format)
    * Always set a `revision` (using the Git commit hash makes sense)
* (Optional) Push the bundle to a server [compatible](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-bundles/#implementations) with OPA's bundle API

Check out the [Policy CI](./.github/workflows/policy-ci.yml) workflow if you need some inspiration.

## Deployment

### Get an API key

For *dtapac* to be able to use the Dependency-Track API, it needs an API key
with the following permissions:

| Permission                  | Reason                              |
|:----------------------------|:------------------------------------|
| `VIEW_PORTFOLIO`            | Fetch project + component info      |
| `VIEW_VULNERABILITY`        | Fetch findings + vulnerability info |
| `VULNERABILITY_ANALYSIS`    | Apply analyses to findings          |
| `VIEW_POLICY_VIOLATION`     | Fetch policy violations             |
| `POLICY_VIOLATION_ANALYSIS` | Apply analyses to policy violations |

It's recommended to create a dedicated team for *dtapac*, like so:

![Team Permissions](./.github/images/deploy_team.png)

### Set up a webhook

Create a new alert with scope `Portfolio` and publisher `Outbound Webhook`:

![Create Alert](./.github/images/deploy_create-alert.png)

Point the destination to *dtapac*'s `/api/v1/dtrack/notification` endpoint and enable the
`NEW_VULNERABILITY` and `POLICY_VIOLATION` groups:

![Configure Alert](./.github/images/deploy_alert.png)

Goes without saying that you should use a domain or hostname that is reach- and resolvable by
your Dependency-Track instance.
